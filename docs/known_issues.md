# Known Issues

## Using Kernel 4.11 and later

RDMA cgroup controller was introduced in version 4.11 of Linux. Kubernetes 1.6 (as of 31st of May 2016) does not support the controller and will prevent `kubelet` from launching. It is necessary to patch Kubernetes and build hyperkube. Following snippet can be used:

```sh
go get k8s.io/kubernetes
git checkout 1.6.4 
git cherry-pick 4e002eacb11777ddfc06c2f4e361e7c453ab4d9d
make all WHAT="cmd/hyperkube" KUBE_BUILD_PLATFORMS="linux/amd64"
```

Compiled binary can be found at `_output/bin/hyperkube`. You should distribute it to all the Kubernetes nodes used for experimentation.

The issue will be fixed in Kubernetes 1.7.

## Using Swan on OpenStack

By default OpenStack flavors places CPUs on separate sockets. Sensitivity Profile Experiment is designed to measure workload interference on single socket and requires at least two cores on a single socket.
To change CPU topology to contain all vCPUs on single socket please refer to [this](https://docs.openstack.org/admin-guide/compute-cpu-topologies.html#customizing-instance-cpu-topologies).
