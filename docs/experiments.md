# Experiments

This project attempts to be scientific regarding experimental results.

For another perspective on this, see the following article from
_Communications of the ACM_ by Don Monroe:

## Lab report outline
Each report should contain at least the following sections:

1. **Introduction**  
Contains background information and explains the purpose of
conducting the experiment.
1. **Hypotheses**  
Lists predicted results and the reasoning behind them.
1. **Methods**  
Explains how the hypotheses are tested in this experiment.
1. **Results**  
Reports the objective data generated during experiment runs.
1. **Conclusions**  
Interprets the data presented in the results section, and analyzes the
extent to which they support each hypothesis.
1. **Future work**  
Gives ideas for further interesting experiments.
1. **References**  
Cites further reading including past work and any resources that
inspired this experiment.

## Planned experiments

1. Evaluate the accuracy of the memory bandwidth estimation algorithm
   from the Heracles paper.
1. Replicate the worst-case slowdowns due to cache interference from
   https://www.mpi-sws.org/~bbb/events/ospert15/pdf/ospert15-p45.pdf,
   test the extent to which CAT can mitigate negative interference.
1. Replicate co-location slowdowns for 429.mcf when running next to
   Spec2006 benchmarks (results from this paper:
