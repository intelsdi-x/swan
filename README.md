# Scheduler Workloads

Repository for automated experiments and data collection targeted enhanced performance isolation and resource oversubscription.

## Instructions

For now, the first supported workload is memcached. Memcached is stressed with the mutilate load generator.
First, you must build memcached and mutilate from source. Go to the [memcached](workloads/data_caching/memcached) workload directory for instructions.

Then, you need to build the resource aggressors:
```
cd aggressors
make
```

Then, you need to install the Swan dependencies. Go to the [library](lib/) directory for instructions.

After installing Swan depencies, you can run the memcached sensitivity profile experiment by:
```
cd experiments/memcached_profile/
# You need to run as root to setup cgroups hierachies.
sudo python main.py
```

After an experiment run, you can view the results in the experiment run data directory.

# Golang instructions

Building experiment (pass the dir name of the scenario within experiment directory) e.g for memcached profile:

`make all EXPERIMENT=memcached_profile`

Tests:

`make test EXPERIMENT=memcached_profile`

If `EXPERIMENT` is not specified - it's `memcached_profile` by default
