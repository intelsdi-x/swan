Repository for automated experiments and data collection targeted enhanced performance isolation and resource oversubscription.

## Instructions

For now, the first supported workload is memcached. Memcached is stressed with the mutilate load generator.
First, you must build memcached and mutilate from source. Go to the [memcached](workloads/data_caching/memcached) workload directory for instructions.

$ go get github.com/intelsdi-x/swan
