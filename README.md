# Project Swan

![Swan diagram](/images/swan-logo.png)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/intelsdi-x/swan.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/intelsdi-x/swan) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/intelsdi-x/swan)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/intelsdi-x/swan)

## Overview
Swan is a distributed experimentation framework for automated experiments targeting performance isolation studies for schedulers. You can read more about the vision behind Swan [here](docs/vision.md).

Swan uses [Snap](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap) to collect, process and tag metrics and stores all experiment data in [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/). From here, we provide a [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) environment to explore and visualize experiment data.

## Quick Start

Swan's Sensitivity Profile Experiment can be quickly run using Vagrant.

Swan requires [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) & [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/). It is recommended to have [vagrant-vbguest](https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest) plugin installed (`$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest`).

### Run the Sensitivity Profile Experiment using Vagrant

Run Vagrant image supplied by Swan:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/intelsdi-x/swan
cd swan/vagrant
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
vagrant box update
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```

Inside guest OS, the Mutilate load generator needs to be build. To do so, please clone the https://github.com/leverich/mutilate repository and build it by using `scons`. After successful build, please copy `mutilate` binary to `/bin`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leverich/mutilate
cd mutilate
scons
sudo ln -sf `pwd`/mutilate /usr/bin/
```
To run experiment, invoke:

```
sudo -E memcached-sensitivity-profile -experiment_be_workloads=caffe -experiment_load_duration=5s -experiment_peak_load=10000 -experiment_repetitions=1 > uuid.txt
```

When experiment is running, please see how to [explore experiment data](/jupyter/README.md) to see results. Note that Experiment UUID that is necessary for obtaining experiment results will be available in `uuid.txt` file.

While the experiment can be run on developer setup from within a virtual machine or on a laptop, this particular experiment is targeted for  distributed cluster environment. For more details, please see [Memcached Sensitivity Profile Documentation](/experiments/memcached-sensitivity-profile/README.md).

### Memcached Sensitivity Profile Experiment

The experiment allows experimenters to generate a so-called _sensitivity profile_, which describes the violation of _Quality of Service_ under certain conditions, such as CPU cache or network bandwidth interference. An example of the _sensitivity profile_ can be seen below.

![Sensitivity profile](/images/sensitivity-profile.png)

During the experiment *memcached* is colocated with several types of _aggressors_, which are low priority (best effort) jobs. Memcached response time is critical and needs to stay below a given value which is called _Service Level Objective_ (SLO). SLO is memcached _Quality of Service_ that needs to be maintained. The goal of the experiment is to learn which aggressors interferes the least and which the most with Memcached so that some of them can be safely colocated with it without violating memcached _Quality of Service_. Colocation of tasks increases machine utilization which in datacenter [can be low as 12%](https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/data-center-efficiency-assessment-IP.pdf) decreasing _TCO_ of the datacenter.

Memcached sensitivity experiment is described in detail in [memcached sensitivity profile document](experiments/memcached-sensitivity-profile/README.md).



## Next Steps

1. Read [Swan Vision](/docs/vision.md) to understand what is Swan and *what is not*.
1. Read about [Workload Interference Theory](/experiments/memcached-sensitivity-profile/docs/theory.md) and see why Noisy Neighbour situations appears in cloud environment.
1. Try other experiments:
   1. [Memcached Sensitivity Profile](/experiments/memcached-sensitivity-profile/README.md)
   1. [Memcached Optimal Core Allocation](/experiments/optimal-core-allocation/README.md)
   1. [Memcached & Cache Allocation Technology](/experiments/memcached-cat/README.md)
1. Read [Architecture Guide](/docs/architecture.md) and [Development Guide](/docs/development.md) and start to build your own experiments!
1. Read [Known Issues](/docs/known_issues.md) to learn about problems that you may encounter while using Swan.
