# Jupyter experiment viewer

## Introduction

> "The Jupyter Notebook is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more." [from jupyter.org](http://jupyter.org/)

Swan uses *Jupyter Notebook* to filter, process and visualize results from experiments.

## Installation

In order to install Jupyter, you need `python` and `pip` installed. On Centos 7, installation of those packages can be achieved by:

```sh
sudo yum install python-pip python-devel
```

or following the instructions at the [official `pip` site](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/#installing-with-get-pip-py).

After `python` and `pip` are installed Jupyter can be installed by typing:

```sh
make deps_jupyter
```
in the Swan root directory.

## Launching Jupyter

In order to start Jupyter go to the Jupyter directory in Swan repository then run `notebook`:

```sh
cd jupyter/
jupyter notebook
```

Jupyter will start locally. Point a web browser to http://127.0.0.1:8888 to access Jupyter notebooks.


## Explore the Example Jupyter Notebook

From within the Jupyter web interface, open a template notebook by clicking on `example.ipynb`.

This is very simple notebook that will generate only sensitivity profile for the experiment.
The first step is to set the following variables:
- `EXPERIMENT_ID` is the identifier of the experiment which will be examined

After filling the variables, navigate to the green box using the keyboard arrows so that it points to the first variable and press `[Shift] [Enter]` to evaluate it. Evaluation actually means executing the code in the box. Evaluate further and observe the output. `Experiment` object's construction will look like:

```python
# An experiment can now be loaded from the database by its ID.
from swan import SensitivityProfile
exp1 = SensitivityProfile(EXPERIMENT_ID, slo=500)
```
It may take a while since it will retrieve data from Cassandra and store it in the variable `exp1` which represents itself as a table:

The last two steps are to render the sensitivity profile from the loaded samples and draw sensitivity chart. The former will be generated after evaluating:

```python
exp1.latency()
```

To learn more about *Sensitivity Profile* read the [Sensitivity Experiment](experiments/memcached-sensitivity-profile/README.md) README.
