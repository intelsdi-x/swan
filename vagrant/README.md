# Local single-node development using Vagrant and Virtualbox

## Quick start

First - install: [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/), [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). Then you just need to execute the following commands (they should work on any flavour of Linux):

To run Vagrant development environment, the `$SWAN_DEVELOPMENT_ENVIRONMENT` variable must be set.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:intelsdi-x/swan.git
cd swan/vagrant
export SWAN_DEVELOPMENT_ENVIRONMENT=true
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest  # automatic guest additions
vagrant box update
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```

When you ssh to your virtual machine execute:

```sh
cd swan
make deps build dist install
```

You will need to build [mutilate](https://github.com/leverich/mutilate) by hand and the result binary need to be available in `$PATH`. Consider copying binary to `/opt/swan/bin` and run:
```sh
sudo ln -svf /opt/swan/bin/* /usr/bin/
```

Now you should be able to run an experiment on the Kubernetes cluster or your virtual machine.

If you want to be able to use [iBench](https://github.com/stanford-mast/iBench) they you will need to compile binaries and make then available in `$PATH` (see mutilate description above). Keep in mind that compiling iBench binaries may require a lot of RAM and can't be done on default Vagrant VM configuration.

## Tuning VM parameters

Vagrant will allocate 2 CPUs and 4096 MB RAM for the VM by default. You can consider changing these values but:
* You need to provide at least 2 CPUs.
* You need to provide at least 4096 MB of RAM.

## Deeper dive

If you want to learn more about VM configuration and installed packages refer to [provisioning script](provision.sh). It calls three other scripts and their names should be self explanatory.

Note that the `~/.glide` directory from your host will be mounted on the VM to speed up Go dependency management.

The scripts are responsible for:
* Installing all the necessary CentOS packages that are needed to build Swan, run experiments and analyse their results.
* Installing [Snap](http://snap-telemetry.io/) and its plugins that are responsible for gathering experiment results.
* Installing [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) that allows running experiment on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster.
* Enabling [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/) and [Etcd](https://coreos.com/etcd) systemd services.
* Installing [hyperkube](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/cluster/images/hyperkube) that is used to set up Kubernetes cluster for experimantation purposes.
* Setting up SSH for root.
* Installing [Go](https://golang.org/).

If you wish to setup experiment environment on another host then you should be able to run [provision_experiment_environment.sh](provision_experiment_environment.sh) on the host. You will need to provide following environmental variables when calling the script:
* `SWAN_USER` - name of the user that will run experiments.
* `HOME_DIR` - home directory of `SWAN_USER`

Example call can be found in [the provisioning script](provision.sh).

### Provisioners

There are two provisioners defined in the [Vagrantfile](Vagrantfile): `aws` and `virtualbox`. Our CI infracture uses the first of them while the second should be used for development. If you try to use `aws` provider on your own it will fail as AMI is not publicly available.
