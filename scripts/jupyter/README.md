# Jupyter experiment viewer

## Installation

You need `python` and `pip` to install the necessary dependencies for Jupyter.
On Centos 7, install the following packages with:

```sh
sudo yum install python-pip python-devel
```

After this, install the python dependencies with `pip` with:

```sh
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Launching jupyter

Start Jupyter by running the following in the `swan/scripts/jupyter` directory:

```sh
jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0
```

If run locally, the command will bring up the default browser.
If not, connect to http://hostname:8888/ through your browser.

## Explore data using Jupyter

From within the Jupyter interface, create a new notebook by clicking on 'New' and 'Python 2'.

Within the new notebook, import the experiments module by typing:

```
from experiment import *
```

And evaluate the expression by clicking shift and enter.
Then, connect to the Cassandra database and load the available samples for an experiment, run:
```
experiment = experiments.experiment(cassandra_cluster=['localhost'], experiment_id='uuid of experiment')
```

Showing the available samples can be done in the similar manner:

![sample list](docs/sample_list.png)

To render a sensitivity profile from the loaded samples, run:
```
profile = Profile(experiment.frame, slo=500)
```

Where 500 is the target latency in micro seconds.

This should render a table similar to the one below:
